Overview:<br>
Project Lambda is a collection of short Python scripts designed to strengthen programming fundamentals through practical problem-solving.<br>
Each file (`e1.py` through `e13.py`) focuses on a specific algorithmic or logical challenge, from basic loops and conditionals to string manipulation, array processing, and simulation-based problems.<br>
The project demonstrates structured problem decomposition, input/output handling, and clean Python syntax for algorithmic exercises.<br>

---

Execution:<br>
Each exercise can be executed individually from the terminal.<br>

Example:<br>
`python e1.py`<br>

All scripts are self-contained and require no external dependencies.<br>

File Structure:<br>
• e1.py – Count fully charged phones<br>
• e2.py – Element at intersecting max-sum row/column<br>
• e3.py – Count rectangles from stick lengths<br>
• e4.py – Replace occurrences of "FOO"<br>
• e5.py – Zig-zag read (work-in-progress)<br>
• e6.py – Team IQ excluding each member<br>
• e7.py – Nearest multiple rounding<br>
• e8.py – Number of reload+fire cycles<br>
• e9.py – Material grading by conditions<br>
• e10.py – Seven-segment display difference cost<br>
• e11.py – Count numbers with odd digit-sum<br>
• e12.py – Time to equalize chocolates<br>
• e13.py – Remove adjacent equal-character pairs<br>
